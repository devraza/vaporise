# Vaporise
Vaporise (`vpr`) is a simple, featureful and memory-safe alternative to the common `rm`, and is written in pure Rust.

> This project is currently a work in progress, and I therefore make no guarantees on stability. There's a lot to be added, too.

## Roadmap
A list of features (or anything else relevant), currently implenented and *not* implemented.
- [X] Deleting directories
- [X] Deleting files
- [X] User-friendly error handling
- [X] Doesn't delete important directories by default (`/` or `~`)
- [ ] Trashing files through a CLI argument
- [ ] Prompting before every, or just the first, removal
